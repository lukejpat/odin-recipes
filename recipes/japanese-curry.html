        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A delicious and homely meal, perfect for winter. This curry is mild, sweet,
            and full of depth. Experiment with preferred ingredients, sometimes
            I throw together this dish with whatever I have in the pantry. That being
            said there are some essentials which will be indicated below.
