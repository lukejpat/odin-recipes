        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A delicious and homely meal, perfect for winter. This curry is mild, sweet,
            and full of depth. Experiment with preferred flavouring ingredients, sometimes
            I throw together this dish with whatever I have in the pantry. That being
            said there are some essentials which will be indicated below.

        <h2>Ingredients to Taste</h2>
        <p>
            The following ingredients are a matter of taste. I would recommend 
            picking 2-3 to add as a start (or if you're really unsure, try the first three in the list
            ), trying to hit different flavour types (umami, sweet, salty, etc.). 
            However, if you are confident then feel free to experiment with ingredients and quantities.
